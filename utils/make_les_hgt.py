"""
Function which takes a terrain type input:
***** gaussian, sinusoidal, plateau, angular *****
and creates idealized terrain heights based on namelist input
information for your idealized WRF run,

Used to create topography for downslope wind storm experiments.
Note that all configurations with have a max height of 1000m.
