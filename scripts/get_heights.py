"""
Function which is used to generate a simplified (ideaized) sounding based on a set file
a desired input shape for the temparature
Examples: neutral->stable
          stable
          exponential
          low-inversion
          high-inversion

Usage: Liam comprehensive exam topic question (Stull)
To get a wind profile, this script calls another which creates
one based on sounding data (see: _____.py)
